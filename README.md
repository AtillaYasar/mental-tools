# mental-tools
things that help me while coding (and maybe in general)

## mental_ram.py
- small text editor that stays on your screen
- example workflow for inventing time travel in picture below (incomplete)
- features: pretty colors, stays on screen, press Escape to print contents, better word boundaries and tab size than base tkinter
