# mental-tools
things that help me while coding (and maybe in general)

## mental_ram.py
- small text editor that stays on your screen
- example workflow for inventing time travel in picture below (incomplete)
- features: 
  - pretty colors
  - stays on screen
  - press Escape to print contents
  - improved word boundaries (for better (shift+) ctrl+arrow navigation) compared to base tkinter
  - improved tab size comapred to base tkinter (2 spaces now)
